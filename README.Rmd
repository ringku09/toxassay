## Overview

ToxAssay is an R-based software package designed for the comprehensive evaluation of drug-induced toxicity utilizing complex toxicogenomics databases. The package offers a comprehensive suite of functions, encompassing: 

* Automated acquisition, preprocessing, and annotation of data by compound name for efficient management.
* Identification of molecular markers for targeted toxicity, including differentially expressed genes (DEGs),adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), functional pathways, and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks.
* Development of optimized machine-learning classifiers for predicting the targeted toxicity in test samples of compounds.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install released version from CRAN
install.packages("toxassay")
```

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install 
the development version of toxassay from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ringku09/toxassay")
```
