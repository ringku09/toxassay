\usage{
test_group(..., error_call = rlang::caller_env())
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Compound groups supplied as vectors, lists, or factors containing compound names or abbreviations.
If a single list is provided, it will be used directly. Otherwise, multiple vectors or lists can be supplied.}

\item{error_call}{The environment in which the error is raised. Default is the caller environment (\code{caller_env()}).}
}
\value{
A named list of compound groups. If names are not provided, they will be automatically assigned as "Group_A", "Group_B", etc.
}
\description{
This function checks and organizes compound groups provided as input arguments.
It ensures that the inputs are of appropriate types (character, factor, or list) and
provides informative error messages if the inputs are not valid.
}
\examples{
# Example with valid input
group1 <- c("compound1", "compound2")
group2 <- c("compound3", "compound4")
test_group(group1, group2)

# Example with a list
groups <- list(group1 = c("compound1", "compound2"), group2 = c("compound3", "compound4"))
test_group(groups)

# Example with mixed input types (this will trigger an error)
\dontrun{
# test_group(group1, group2, list("compound5"))
}
}
